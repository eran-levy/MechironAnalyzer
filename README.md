# MechironAnalyzer
## Overview
[Mechiron] (http://www.mechiron.org) has been developed in order to unify the products information, its prices and other relevant metadata being published by the largest grocery stores in Israel on a daily basis and visualize into beautiful dashboards.
Now that its all **unified** into one place, anyone can navigate through the data, slice & dice and drill down into specific product's information easily.The information published by law and being updated frequently during the day (2~ hours). 

## Goal
It is a **non-profit initiative** and the goal is to give the power to the public! So anyone can navigate through the prices, manufacturers' details and other interesting information to spot trends and see in a **bird's eye-view** market information. 
Whats the price of a specific product over time?
Who are the main manufacturers that compete on the money that we spend as consumers?
What are the pricing trends for a specific products category?
and much more!

## The overall project structure
The **Mechiron** project has been seperated into 2 GitHub repositories:
1. [Mechiron repository] (https://github.com/eran-levy/Mechiron) - is responsible to gather the information published from the configured FTP sources and export into a unified CSV format. Written in Python and can be extended easily. For more information see the GitHub repository README.
2. MechironAnalyzer (this GitHub repository) - which is reponsible for the data processing.
